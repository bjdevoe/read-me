Introduction to the world of coders
My name is Benjamin DeVoe and I am a student attending American Public University full-time. I was able to obtain a legal copy of Visual Studio 2015 through my DreamSparks's account and felt it was about time I learned to code properly. I have some experience with programming JAVA, but that was years ago. I know there are plenty of resources on the Internet to help me learn, but I felt setting up an account here, to learn from experience coders, was a wonderful option I had available to me. I look forward to collaberating with you all.
